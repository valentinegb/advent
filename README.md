# `advent`

CLI for running Advent of Code puzzles that I've solved

## What?

This is a project I've made to organize all of the Advent of Code puzzles that I've completed. It's a command line interface, and it's usage is like this:

```
advent <YEAR> <DAY> <PART> <INPUT>
```

So running a puzzle in practice looks like this:

```shell
$ advent 2015 3 1 "^>v<"
4
```

Run `advent --help` for more information.

## Why?

I wanted to start keeping the puzzles I've been completing so that I can look back at them later and see how I've improved. Also, if anyone else doing Advent of Code puzzles would like to, they can ~~copy and paste~~ take inspiration from my code.

Joking aside, please don't look at my puzzle solutions unless you've already done the puzzle yourself or you don't plan on doing it. I find that to be against the spirit of Advent of Code. Challenge yourself! Copying and pasting isn't very challenging, anyone can do that.
